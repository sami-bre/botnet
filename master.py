# this will be the master script that allows me to controll
# zombies.

# some of the features to be implemented are:
#   looking at the execution history of a certain zombie (the table of the zombie, e.g. table z3)
#   looking at the waiting command of a certian zombie (from the 'zombies' table)
#   modifying the waiting command of a certain zombie

# I assume this script will run on the terminal and it will have a main loop
